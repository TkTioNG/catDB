## Overview

Cat DB is a small API project that was developed using Django REST framework. The project will be consisting 3 major tasks:

1. Creating models and expose them over the API
2. Allowing CRUD by using expiring authentication token
3. Add test cases on serializers and views

## Requirements

- Python (3.7.6)
- Django (3.1.1)
- Django REST Framework (3.12.1)

*Noted that the requirements are based on the developing environment of the project.*

## Example

### Launch
As the project is developed with `VS Code`, one may directly launch and debug the project by using the launch.json written.

Moreover, the project can be launched by the following procedures:

1. Open a terminal and redirect to the root of the project.

2. Run the following code:

```
> python manage.py runserver
```

3. By default, the project can be accessed through the url link: http://localhost:8000.

### API Endpoints
Below are a few API endpoint that can be accessed:

1. API Root (http://localhost:8000/catapp/api/)
   The browsable api root that provide all the links to other browsable api endpoints, such as [breeds](http://localhost:8000/catapp/api/breeds), [cats](http://localhost:8000/catapp/api/cats), [homes](http://localhost:8000/catapp/api/homes) and [humans](http://localhost:8000/catapp/api/humans).
   JSON format can be obtained by stating `format="json"`, in the url or in the `requests` method.

```
{
  "breeds":"http://localhost:8000/catapp/api/breeds/?format=json",
  "cats":"http://localhost:8000/catapp/api/cats/?format=json",
  "homes":"http://localhost:8000/catapp/api/homes/?format=json",
  "humans":"http://localhost:8000/catapp/api/humans/?format=json"
}
```

2. API Token Auth (http://localhost:8000/catapp/api-token-auth/)
   The endpoint that allow the registered user to obtain or renew their tokens. In this endpoint, only `POST` method is allowed by providing `username` and `password` for authentication purpose.
   A token will be provided in json format as below:

```
{
  "token": "86e95acc081be510c482174869bea25f5df04461"
}
```

### Features
The API provides HTTP methods, such as: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD` AND `OPTIONS`, on all the endpoints except for [API Token Auth](http://localhost:8000/catapp/api-token-auth/).

Among all the HTTP methods, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` are required to have a valid token authentication in order to be performed. 

**Token** can only be generated by using the valid User in `auth.User` and can be created or renewed through the (API Token Auth)[http://localhost:8000/catapp/api-token-auth/] endpoint. 

*Noted that the token will be expired in 24 hours upon the success generation, hence, it will need to be renewed constantly.*
